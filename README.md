<!-- badges: end -->

It is a common task to solve an optimization problem when the objective
is computed using an external application, e.g.Â an adaptive
finite-element PDE solver, that gets its input from the command line and
writes its output to a number of files. The `solvergater` package
provides a simple R gateway to such external apps.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of solvergater from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
-->

<!--
``` r
install.packages("solvergater")
```
-->

<!--
And 
-->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maciejsmolka/solvergater")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to run an external solver to
compute the quantity of interest and its Jacobian matrix with respect to
the parameters. The example uses a mock solver provided with the
package.

``` r
library(solvergater)
rscript_path <- file.path(R.home(), "bin", "Rscript")
solver_path <- file.path(find.package("solvergater"), "exec", "fake_simple.R")
nparams <- 4
nqoi <- 5
solver_cmd <- paste(rscript_path, solver_path, nparams, nqoi)
s <- shell_solver(solver_cmd, nparams = nparams, qoi_file = "output_qoi",
                  jacobian_file = "output_jacobian", wd = tempdir())
run(s, c(20.11, 5, -1.2, 10.4), 10)
